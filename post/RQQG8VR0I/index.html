Rules and Conventions</p>
<p>Roger Caillois, Man, Play, and Gam<br>
es :</p>
<p>“Any game is a system of rules. These define what is or not a game, that is, what is allowed and what is forbidden. These conventions are at the same time arbitrary, imperative, and without appeal. They cannot be violated on any account, or else the game ends right away and is destroyed by the same fact. ([1958] 1961, pp. 11–12, my translation)” (pdf)</p>
<p>“Conventions are then not seen as constitutive or operational rules. They are unwritten and/or implicit rules.” (pdf)</p>
<p>“On the contrary, conventions “cannot be broken; they can only be ignored or neglected”” (pdf)<br>
The Rules of Conventions</p>
<p>“In Peter J. Rabinowitz’s aforementioned theory of narrative, reading fiction is a conventional activity as it presupposes an assumed contract between author and reader where reality is to be understood according to certain paradigms.” (pdf) Who's the one that making contract in the game's case?</p>
<p>“Following Jesper Juul’s discussion in Half-Real: Videogames between Real Rules and Fictional Worlds: “Rules separate the game from the rest of the world by carving out an area where the rules apply; fiction projects a world different from the real world” (2005, p. 164).” (pdf)</p>
<p>“In video games, the rules are initially hidden from the player—this means the player is more likely to use the game world to make inferences about the rules. In fact, the player may need a fictional game world to understand the rules.” (pdf) Also from (Juul 2005). Game as the intermediate b/w rules and player, instead of rules b/w game and player. But how about tabletop games, are they the same?<br>
Gameplay Conventions</p>
<p>“video games have remediated conventions from theater and film.” (pdf) notice the relation of games, theater and film</p>
<p>“The first type of gameplay convention—briefly discussed above—consists of the ones giving the gamer support or information so that s/he can play the game more easily.” (pdf)</p>
<p>“The second general type of conventions is composed of the ones that hinder the gamer’s progression and success.” (pdf) in other words, challenge<br>
Genre Conventions</p>
<p>“conventions do move from one genre to another so as to widen or renew the experience of a genre.” (pdf)<br>
Narrative and Ohter Conventions at Play</p>
<p>“Indeed, not all video games tell stories. But when they do, mostly in the course of the campaign or journey of single-player games, they rely on a prevalent method, that is, on a “typical oscillation between [cut-scenes] and play.”” (pdf)</p>
<p>“The conflict revolves around the good vs. evil paradigm. No matter the various/numerous forces involved or the sinuous road taken and, above all, regardless of the number of failures (or “game overs”) the gamer experiences or how long it takes him/her to progress, the player-character always succeeds (or always ends in defeat in arcade games, where it is a question of how long the gamer can last).”</p>
